# Welcome to the Palermo Lab GitHub!
We are a [Computational Biophysics Group](https://palermolab.com/) at the [University of California Riverside](https://www.ucr.edu/). 

Future medicines will modify DNA and RNA to treat a wide range of diseases. Our lab drives this transformation by advancing computer simulations and deep learning approaches to characterize and engineer genome editing systems that are transforming life sciences.

Our approach includes graph neural networks (GNNs), diffusion and language models, causation inference and and cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) processing techniques. Our findings are integrated with experimental techniques, including cryo-EM, single-molecule spectroscopy, and NMR.
