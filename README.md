# Welcome to the Palermo Lab GitHub!
We are a [Computational Biophysics Group](https://palermolab.com/) at the [University of California Riverside](https://www.ucr.edu/), with expertise in molecular dynamics and multiscale modeling, ab-initio and quantum mechanical methods, and in cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) refinement techniques. Our research focuses on large-scale simulations of proteins and nucleic acids, with particular interest in emerging genome editing technologies and CRISPR systems.
